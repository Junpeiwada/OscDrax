### Your Fingertips Create New Sounds

OscDrax is an innovative iOS waveform synthesizer that enables professional sound design through intuitive touch controls. Simply draw waveforms with your finger to instantly create original tones. Combine four independent tracks to build complex, rich soundscapes.

### üé® Unleash Creativity with the Waveform Editor

Our waveform drawing system maximizes the potential of touchscreen technology. With 512-point high resolution, accurately reproduce any waveform you imagine. Classic waveforms like sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth are also available at a single tap. Designed for everyone from beginners to professionals.

### üéµ 4-Track Multi-Timbral Synthesis

Each track operates completely independently with its own waveform, frequency, and volume settings. Layer multiple tracks simultaneously to create thick, complex tones impossible with a single oscillator.
